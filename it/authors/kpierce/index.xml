      <description>Karen Pierce is a Professor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in the Department of Neurosciences and is Co-Director, UCSD Autism Center of Excellence. Prof Pierce has been studying autism for over 20 years and is a leading expert on the neural and clinical phenotype of ASD. Her research spans a range of topics from early screening and detection to eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Her early detection approach that focuses on mobilizing pediatricians, called the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, has identified several hundred ASD toddlers around the 1st birthday and has resulted in rapid treatment access.</description>
